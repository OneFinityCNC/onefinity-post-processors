# Overview
My personal [Home Assistant Container](https://home-assistant.io) configurations with 300+ automations.  These are my active automations and configurations that I use every day.  Updated frequently as I add more devices and come up with more and more complicated ways to do simple tasks.

| [Bond Home](https://amzn.to/3i7dLds)| 1 | Wi-Fi | [Bond Home](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bond/) | Controls ceiling fans and lights via RF remote control commands.  Existing fans are each wired to a single switch that controls both power and light with fan and light controls done via a physical remote.  The Bond Home Hub allowed for sending of those RF remote commands via the hub and the local API makes it possible to send said commands from Home Assistant. |


Relevant hub configurations can be found within [configuration.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/configuration.yaml)

Many of my automations rely on some form of lighting but many examples can be found in [lights.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/lights.yaml) and [location.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml).

Lights are grouped via [light_group.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/light_group.yaml)

## <a name="climate">Climate</a>

I utilize a number of automations that adjust climate controls.  Mostly they can be found in [climate.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/climate.yaml). Ecobee room sensors are heavily used in [occupancy.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/occupancy.yaml) and as conditions in many automations

More detailed information on the ESPhome configuration can be found in [here](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/tree/master/esphome/garage_door_relay)

| [Wemo Insight Smart Plug](https://amzn.to/2CfzHRa) | 2 | Wi-Fi | [Belkin WeMo](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/wemo/) | Smart outlet utilized to monitor power to washing machine and dryer|
| [Zooz Power Switch ZEN15](https://amzn.to/2WRPeiv) | 2 | Vera Plus (Z-Wave) | [Vera Switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/vera/) | Smart outlet utilized to monitor power to sump pump |

Switches and outlets are used in various capacities, some are for lighting and some are for fans type devices.  [lights.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/lights.yaml) and [occupancy.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/occupancy.yaml) should have some good examples.

Washing machine is automated around the Wemo Insight Plug.  This outlet can monitor power consumption, I created a [sensor](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/sensors.yaml) based on the power reading that shows a simple status of running or not running thus [automating](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/laundry.yaml) around that sensor.

## <a name="locks">Locks</a>

| [Schlage Connect Touchscreen Deadbolt](https://amzn.to/2KwXltd) | 3 | Vera Plus (Z-Wave) | [Vera Lock](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/vera/) | Smart locks used in automations to auto lock / unlock doors |

Locks are used mostly as a way to lock / unlock doors based on locations, see [location.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and [locks.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/locks.yaml) for some examples

## <a name="security">Security</a>

| [GoControl Door/Window Sensor](https://amzn.to/2wOhLfn) | 3 | Vera Plus (Z-Wave) | [Vera Binary Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/vera/) | Door sensors to detect if exterior doors have been opened / closed |

Door sensors, motion sensors, and the alarm siren are used in many different ways via [alarm.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/alarm.yaml).  I've also implemented some of the alarm functions as part of [water_sensors.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/water_sensors.yaml).

## <a name="voice">Voice Assistant</a>

| [Amazon Echo Show 5](https://amzn.to/3sPEh09) | 1 | Wi-Fi | [Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/) |Voice Assistant with display 

I go for native Echo integration wherever possible, but a few devices are not currently supported where I've had to implement some work arounds via Home Assistant Cloud (previously Emulated Hue).  Most of these are just exposed via an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml) and [customize.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/customize.yaml).  This allows the ability to have echo turn on or off an [input_boolean]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_boolean.yaml)  in turn triggering an automation.

Most media player based automations can be found in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml) and some Text to Speech (TTS) based automation in various automations.

Harmony Hubs work via a combination of [input_selects]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/input_select.yaml), [scripts]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/scripts.yaml), and automations in [media.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/media.yaml).

Water sensors serve one major function, to alert me to the presence of water.  Almost all of those automations can be fond via [water_works.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/water_works.yaml)

Smoke detectors, like the water sensors, have one real function to alert me of smoke or CO2.  Almost all of those automations can be fond via [smoke_alarm.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/smoke_alarm.yaml)

Nothing is currently automated around cameras, just a [UI](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/images/camera-screenshot.jpg) element.  The Ring doorbell is used in a number of ways to trigger an action based on motion detection or someone ringing the doorbell.  Examples can be found in [doorbell.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/doorbell.yaml)

I also send camera feeds as a payload on a few iOS notifications, those can mostly be found in [notification_text.yaml](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/notification_text.yaml)

Since I don’t use the network equipment as my primary presence detection method most of the automation is around house guests via [house_guest.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/house_guest.yaml).  The main function of the network equipment is to be network equipment for my fiber internet service.

The iOS app is used for some notifications within various automations. The native iOS app is the main method of doing any location based automations via [location.yaml]( https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant/blob/master/automation/location.yaml) and many of the conditions I use are based on presence detection of household members.

| [Wink Hub v1](https://amzn.to/2wMUjis)| 1 | Wi-Fi | [Wink](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/wink/) | ~~Semi retired, using it as a z-wave repeater for Vera.~~ Once upon a time I really loved Wink, but when you don't stock hardware for almost a year and your buisness model is selling hardware... time for that slow ride to the Cloud API in the sky. Not to mention the massive outages when staff clock out and don't fix until morning (forget to renew an expired certificate anyone). It was a fun ride Wink, hopefully your death will not be to slow and painful, but i.am+ wants to watch the world burn... probably.|

Wink interface was rubbish and was replaced with the Home Assistant dashboard. It provides binary sensors for the two push buttons, temperature, and humidity sensors. Doesn't get used much but looks cool. Turns out it was just rubbish and decided to go into an endless reboot loop, on top of the screen already having burn in problems even when not on all the time.
